=== Links

There are two type of links.

Links with no text <http://www.example.com>
Link with text <https://www.google.com>(Google)

Link with markup inside texts: <https://www.github.com>(*go _here!_*)


Invalid links (that looks similar to html tags) will be ignored, for example <b>, </i>, <a href="">...

=== Images

Images are just some link with a `!` before.

Images are inlined: <//hmark.nipin.xyz>(!</favicon.png>)

Large image will be resized:
!</imgs/screenshot.png>(screenshot)
