Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Block `code` fenced by lines with at least three back-ticks `\`\`\``.
Note that the closing fence must have the same amount of `\``.

Syntax highlight:

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

```js
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

````md
```rb
puts 'no syntax highlight on nested code block'
```
````


Again, to see what languages are available for highlighting, and how to write those language names, see the <http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html>(highlight.js demo page).
